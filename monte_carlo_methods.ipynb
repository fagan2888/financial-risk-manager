More generally, any distribution function can be generated as long as the cumulative distribution function can be inverted.\n",

    "Bond prices display long-term reversion to the face value, which represents the repayment of principal at maturity (assuming there is no default). Such a process is inconsistent with $GBM$ process, which displays no such mean reversion. The volatility of bond prices also changes in a predictable fashion, as duration shrinks to $0$. Similarly, commodities often display mean reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features can be taken into account by modeling bond yields directly in a first step. In the next step, bond prices are constructed from the value of yields and a pricing function. The dynamics of interest rates $r_{t}$ can be modeled by \n",

When the current interest rate is high (i.e., $r_{t} > \\theta$), the model creates a negative drift $\\kappa(\\theta - r_{t})$ toward $\\theta$. Conversely, low current rates create a positive drift toward $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second feature is the volatility process. This model includes the **Vasicek model** when $\\gamma = 0$. Changes in yields are normally distributed because $\\Delta r$ is then a linear function of $\\Delta z$, which is itself normal. The Vasicek model is particular convenient because it leads to closed-form solutions for many fixed-income products. The problem, however, is that it could potentially lead to negative interest rates when the initial rate starts from a low value. This is because the volatility of the change in rates does not depend on the level, unlike that in the geometric Brownian motion."

    "The $\\Delta r_{t}$ equation is more general, however, because it includes a power of the yield in the variance function. With $\\gamma = 1$, this is the **lognormal model**. Ignoring the trend, this gives $\\Delta r_{t} = \\sigma r_{t}\\Delta z_{t}$, or $\\Delta r_{t}/r_{t} = \\sigma \\Delta z_{t}$. This implies that the rate of change in the yield $dr/r$ has a fixed variance. Thus, as with the $GBM$ model, smaller yields lead to smaller movements, which makes it unlikely the yield will drop below $0$. This model is more appropriate than the normal model when the initial yield is close to $0$."

    "Then we are going to discuss the effect of **sampling variability**. Unless $K$ is extremely large, the empirical distribution of $S_{T}$ will only be an approximation of the true distribution. There will be some natural variation in statistics measured from Monte Carlo simulations. Since Monte Carlo simulations involve independent draws, one can show that the standard error of statistics is inversely related to the square root of $K$. Thus more simulations will increase precision, but at a slow rate. For example, accuracy is increased by a factor of $10$ going from $K = 10$ to $K = 1,000$, but then requires going from $K = 1,000$ to $K = 100,000$ for the same factor of $10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This accuracy issue is worse for risk management than for pricing, because the quantiles are estimated less precisely than the average. For $VAR$ measures, the precision is also a function of the selected confidence level. Higher confidence levels generate fewer observations in the left tail and hence less precise $VAR$ measures. A $99\\%$ $VAR$ using $1,000$ replications should be expected to have only $10$ observations in the left tail, which is not a large number. The $VAR$ estimate is derived from the $10$th and $11$th sorted numbers. In contrast, a $95\\%$ $VAR$ is measured from the $15$th and $51$st sorted numbers, which is more precise. In addition, the precision of the estimated quantile depends on the shape of the distribution. Relative to a symmetric distribution, a short option position has negative skewness, or a long left tail. The observations in the left tail therefore will be more dispersed, making is more difficult to estimate $VAR$ precisely."
