    "Risk management starts with the pricing of assets. The simplest assets to study are regular, fixed-coupon bonds. Because their cash flows are predetermined, we can translate their stream of cash flows into a present value by discounting at a fixed interest rate. Thus the valuation of bonds involves understanding compounded interest and discounting, as well as the relationship between present values and interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk management goes one step further than pricing. It examines potential changes in the price of assets as the interest rate changes. We assume there is a single interest rate, or yield, that is used to price the bond. This will be our fundamental risk factor.\n",

    "An investor buys a zero-coupon bond that pays $\\$100$ in $10$ years. Because the investment is guaranteed by the U.S. government, we assume that there is no credit risk. So, there is a default-free bond, which is exposed to market risk only. Market risk arises because of possible fluctuations in the market price of this bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "To value this $\\$100$ payment, we need a **discounting factor**. This is also the **interest rate**, or more simply the **yield**. Define $C_{t}$ as the cash flow at time $t$ and the discounting factor as $y$. We define $T$ as the number of periods until maturity (e.g., number of years), also known as **tenor**. The **present value (PV)** of the bond can be computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$PV = \\frac{C_{T}}{(1+y)^T}$\n",

    "So, all else fixed, the market value of zero-coupon bonds decreases with longer maturities. Also, keeping $T$ fixed, the value of the bond decreases as the yield increases.\n",

    "Note that the interest rate should be stated along with the method used for compounding. Annual compounding is very common. However, other conventions exist. For instance, the U.S. Treasury market uses semiannual compounding. Define in this case $y^{S}$ as the rate based on semiannual compounding. To maintain comparability, it is expressed in annualized form (i.e., after multiplication by $2$). The number of periods, or semesters, is now $2T$. The formula for finding $y^{S}$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "When the coupon rate $c$ precisely matches the yield $y$, using the same compounding frequency, the present value of the bond must be equal to the face value. The bond is said to be a **par bond**. If the coupon is greater than the yield, the price must be greater than the face value, which means that this is a **premium bond**. Conversely, if the coupon is lower, or even zero for a zero-coupon bond, the price must be less than the face value, which means that this is a **discount bond**.\n",

    "In tisk management terms, the price-yield function for a $10$-year bond with a $6\\%$ annual coupon is also the relationship between the payoff on the asset and the risk factor. At a yield of $6\\%$, the price is at par, $P = \\$100$. Higher yields imply lower prices. This is an example of a **payoff function**, which links the price to the underlying risk factor.\n",
