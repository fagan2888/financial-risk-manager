    "# Bond Fundamentals\n",
    "Risk management starts with the pricing of assets. The simplest assets to study are regular, fixed-coupon bonds. Because their cash flows are predetermined, we can translate their stream of cash flows into a present value by discounting at a fixed interest rate. Thus the valuation of bonds involves understanding compounded interest and discounting, as well as the relationship between present values and interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk management goes one step further than pricing. It examines potential changes in the price of assets as the interest rate changes. We assume there is a single interest rate, or yield, that is used to price the bond. This will be our fundamental risk factor.\n",

    "An investor buys a zero-coupon bond that pays $\\$100$ in $10$ years. Because the investment is guaranteed by the U.S. government, we assume that there is no credit risk. So, there is a default-free bond, which is exposed to market risk only. Market risk arises because of possible fluctuations in the market price of this bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "To value this $\\$100$ payment, we need a **discounting factor**. This is also the **interest rate**, or more simply the **yield**. Define $C_{t}$ as the cash flow at time $t$ and the discounting factor as $y$. We define $T$ as the number of periods until maturity (e.g., number of years), also known as **tenor**. The **present value (PV)** of the bond can be computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$PV = \\frac{C_{T}}{(1+y)^T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, all else fixed, the market value of zero-coupon bonds decreases with longer maturities. Also, keeping $T$ fixed, the value of the bond decreases as the yield increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, we can compute the **future value (FV)** of the bond as \n",
    "\n",
    "$FV = PV \\times (1 + y)^{T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield has a useful interpretation, which is that of an **internal rate of return** on the bond, or annual growth rate. It is easier to deal with rates of return than with dollar values. Rates of return, when expressed in percentage terms and on an annual basis, are directly comparable across assets. An annualized yield is sometimes defined as the **effective annual rate (EAR)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the interest rate should be stated along with the method used for compounding. Annual compounding is very common. However, other conventions exist. For instance, the U.S. Treasury market uses semiannual compounding. Define in this case $y^{S}$ as the rate based on semiannual compounding. To maintain comparability, it is expressed in annualized form (i.e., after multiplication by $2$). The number of periods, or semesters, is now $2T$. The formula for finding $y^{S}$ is\n",

    "$PV = \\frac{C_{T}}{(1 + y^{s}/2)^{2T}}$\n",

    "For instance, a Treasury zero-coupon bond with a maturity of $T = 10$ years would have $2T = 20$ semiannual compounding periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "$1 + y = (1 + y^{s}/2)^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous compounding is often used when modeling derivatives. It is the limit of the case where the number of compounding periods per year increases to infinity. The continously compounded interest rate $y^{C}$ is derived from\n",

    "The fundamental discounting relationship can be extended to any bond with a fixed cash-flow pattern. We can write the present value of a bond $P$ as the discounted value of future cash flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P = \\sum^{T}_{t=1} \\frac{C_{t}}{(1 + y)^{t}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "\n",
    "* $C_{t}$ = the cash flow (coupon or principal) in period $t$\n",
    "* $t$ = the number of periods (e.g., half-years) to each payment\n",
    "* $T$ = the number of periods to final maturity\n",
    "* $y$ = the discounting factor per period (e.g., $y^{s}/2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical cash-flow pattern consists of a fixed coupon payment plus the re-payment of the principal, or **face value** at expiration. Define $c$ as the coupon rate and $F$ as the face value. We have $C_{t} = cF$ prior to expiration, and at expiration, we have $C_{T} =cF + F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the coupon rate $c$ precisely matches the yield $y$, using the same compounding frequency, the present value of the bond must be equal to the face value. The bond is said to be a **par bond**. If the coupon is greater than the yield, the price must be greater than the face value, which means that this is a **premium bond**. Conversely, if the coupon is lower, or even zero for a zero-coupon bond, the price must be less than the face value, which means that this is a **discount bond**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation describes the relationship between the yield $y$ and the value of the bond $P$, given its cash-flow characteristics. In other words, the value $P$ can also be written as a nonlinear function of the yield $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P = f(y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, we can set $P$ to the current market price of the bond, including any accrued interest. From this, we can compute the implied yield that will solve this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tisk management terms, the price-yield function for a $10$-year bond with a $6\\%$ annual coupon is also the relationship between the payoff on the asset and the risk factor. At a yield of $6\\%$, the price is at par, $P = \\$100$. Higher yields imply lower prices. This is an example of a **payoff function**, which links the price to the underlying risk factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over a wide range of yield values, this is a highly nonlinear relationship. For instance, when the yield is zero, the value of the bond is simply the sum of cash flows, or $\\$160$ in this case. When the yield tends to very large values, the bond price tends to zero. For small movements around the initial yield of $6\\%$, the relationship is quasilinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a particularly simple relationship for **consols**, or **perpetual bonds**, which are bonds making regular coupon payments but with no redemption date. For a consol, the maturity is infinite and the cash flows are all equal to a fixed percentage of the face value, $C_{t} = C = cF$. As a result, the price can be simplified to \n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, the price is simply proportional to the inverse of the yield. Higher yields lead to lower bond prices, and vice versa."
