    "# Introduction to Derivatives\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of derivatives markets. Derivatives are financial contracts traded in private **over-the-counter (OTC)** markets or on **organized exchanges**. As the term implies, derivatives derive their value from some underlying index, typically the price of an asset. Depending on the type of relationship, they can be broadly classified into two categories: linear and nonlinear instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the first category belong forward rate agreements (FRAs), futures, and swaps. Their value is a linear function of the underlying index. These are obligations to exchange payments according to a specified schedule. Forward contracts involve one payment and are relatively simple to evaluate. So are futures, which are traded on exchanges. Swaps involve a series of payments and generally can be reduced to portfolios of forward contracts. To the second category belong options, whose value is a nonlinear function of the underlying index.\n",

    "### Definitions\n",
    "A **derivative instrument** can be generally defined as a private contract whose value derives from some underlying asset price, reference rate, or index - such as a stock, bond, currency, or commodity. In addition, the contract must also specify a principal, or **notional** amount, which is defined in terms of currency, shares, bushels, or some other unit. Movements in the value of the derivative depend on the notional and on the underlying price or index.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast with **securities**, such as stocks and bonds, which are issued to raise capital, derivatives are **contracts**, or private agreements between two parties. Thus the sum of gains and losses on derivatives contracts must be zero. For any gain made by one party, the other party must have suffered a loss of equal magnitude.\n",

    "### Size of Derivatives Markets\n",
    "At the broadest level, derivatives markets can be classified by the underlying instrument, as well as by the type of trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table shows that interest rate contracts, especially swaps, are the most widespread type of derivatives. On the OTC market, currency contracts are also widely used, especially outright forwards and **forex swaps**, which are a combination of spot and short-term forward transactions. Among exhange-traded instruments, interest rate futures and options are the most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notional amounts give an indicaton of equivalent positions in cash markets. For example, a long futures contract on a stock index with a notional of $\\$1$ million is equivalent to a cash position in the stock market of the same magnitude. They are also important because they drive the fees to the financial industry, which are typically set as a fraction of the notionals."

    "### Trading Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivatives can be traded in private decentralized markets, called **over-the-counter (OTC)** markets, or on **organized exchanges**. Trading OTC is generally done with a **derivatives dealer**, which is a specially organized firm, usually associated with a major financial institution, that buys and sells derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major issue when dealing with derivatives is **counterparty risk**. A counterparty is defined as the opposite side of a financial transaction. Suppose that Bank A entered a derivative contract with Hedge Fund B, where A agrees to purchase the euro by selling dollars ar a fixed price of $\\$1.3$. If the euro goes up, the contract moves in-the-money for A. However, this means that B suffers a loss. If this loss is large enough, B could default. Hence, this contract creates credit risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Derivatives dealers manage their counterparty risk through a variety of means. Even so, these potential exposures are a major concern. This explains why American International Group (AIG) was rescued by the U.S. government. AIG had sold credit default swaps (CDSs) to many other institutions, and its failure could have caused domino effects for other banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counterparty risk can be addressed with a **clearinghouse**. A clearinghouse is a financial institution that provides settlement and clearing services for financial transactions that may have taken place on an organized exhange or OTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a clearinghouse is to reduce counterparty risk by interposing itself between the buyer and the seller, thereby ensuring payments on the contract. This is why clearinghouses are said to provide **central counterparty (CCP)** clearing. This is done through a process called **novation**, which refers to the replacement of a contract between two counterparties with a contract between the remaining party and a third party. However, clearinghouses may also offer other services than CCP clearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearinghouses reduce counterparty risk by a variety of means. First, they allow netting, of offsetting, transactions between counterparties due to the fungibility of the contracts. For example, suppose that Bank A bought $\\$100$ million worth of euros from B. At the same time, it sold an otherwise identical contract to Bank C in the amount of $\\$80$ million. If the two trades had gone through the same clearinghouse, the net exposure of Bank A would be $\\$20$ million only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, clearinghouse have in place procedures to manage their credit risk. They require **collateral deposit**, also called margins, which must be adjusted on a daily basis or more frequently. They mark contracts to market based on independent valuation of traders. Should the **clearing member** fail to add to the collateral when needed, the clearinghouse has the right to liquidate the position. In addition, clearinghouses generally rely on a guarantee fund provided by clearing members that can be used to cover losses in a default event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning now to the trading aspects, an **organized exchange**, or **bourse**, is a highly organized market where financial instruments are bought and sold. Trading can occur either in a physical location or electronically. The most active stock market in the world is the **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)**, Another example is the **CME group**, which is the largest derivatives market in the world. Trading at the CME is conducted in open outcry format, or electonically through Globex. In 2009, Globex announced for $80\\%$ of total trading at the CME.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most exchanges are **public**, trade public securities, and require registration with a local regulator, such as Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). **Private** exchanges, in contrast, are not registered and allow for the trading of unregistered securities, such as private placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "All exchanges have a clearinghouse. A clearinghouse may be dedicated to one or several exchanges. As an example of the first case, which is also called **vertical integration**, CME Clearing is the in-house clearer for the CME Group. In contrast, the **Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)** supports $14$ exchanges and platforms, including the Chicago Board Option Exchange and NYSE Amex. LCH Clearnet Group handles many of the trades in major European financial exchanges. This model is called **horizontal integration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "OTC trading does not require a clearinghouse. This is changing slowly, however. About $25\\%$ of interest rate swaps are now routed through clearinghouses. Similarly, ICE Trust, the U.S.-based electronic futures exchange group, has started to clear CDS index contracts. Legistration will surely push more opposed to CCPs because these would cut into their business and porfits.\n",
    "\n",
    "CCPs have other advantages. They create **transparency** in financial markets. Because the trading information is now stored centrally, CCPs can disseminate information about transactions, prices, and positions. This was a major issue with AIG because apparently regulators were not aware of the extent of AIG's short CDS positions. Thus CCPs could be used for trade **reporting**. Currently, most electronic trades of credit derivatives are reported to the **Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)**, which is a financial institution that settles the vast majority of securities transactions in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, clearinghouses have disadvantages as well. They do not eliminate counterparty risk in the financial system but rather concentrate it among themselves. Even if CCPs are more creditworthy than most other parties, a CCP failure could create systematic risk. CCPs generally have very high credit ratings, for example AAA for the OCC. CCP failures have been extremely rare, but could happen again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulators are contemplating whether CCPs should have access to the lending facilities of a central bank. Of course, this creates a problem of moral hazard, which is a situation where clearers would have less incentive to create a robust structure because they know that central banks would ride to their rescue anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the risk manager aspect of positions is very important. CCPs have been able to handle simple, standardized contracts, which are easy to price. Forcing more complex instruments to clearinghouses may not be very liquid, which could cause large losses in case of a forced liquidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, CCPs' netting benefits would be defeated by having too many existing CCPs. In our example of Bank A with clients B and C, there is no netting if the two trades are routed to two different CCPs. Further, having CCPs for different produces would reduce the effectiveness of International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements because these allow netting across many different products. Such agreements are called **bilateral** because they cover a variety of trades between only two parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The establishment of CCPs creates a global coordination problem. The United States, United Kingdom, and continental Europe all want their own CCP because their CCP might need to be backstopped by the local central bank. Reguation might also be needed to avoid CCPs competing against each other by setting low margins, which would make them less safe.\n",

    "## <a name=\"forward-contracts\">Forward Contracts</a>\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The most common transactions in financial instruments are **spot transactions**, that is, for physical delivery as soon as practical (perhaps in two business days or in a week). Historically, grain farmers went to a centralized location to meet buyers for their product. As markets developed, the farmers realized that it would be beneficial to trade for delivery at some future date. This allowed them to hedge out price fluctuations for the sale of their anticipated production.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gave rise to **forward contracts**, which are private agreements to exchange a given asset against cash (or sometimes another asset) at a fixed point in the future. The terms of the contract are the quantity (number of units or shares), date, and price at which the exchange will be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "A position that implies buying the asset is said to be **long**. A position to sell is said to be **short**. Any gain to one party must be a loss to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "These instruments represent contractual obligations, as the exchange must occur whatever happens to the intervening price, unless default occurs. Unlike an option contract, there is no choice to take delivery or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the possibility of losses, the farmer could enter a forward sale of grain for dollars. By so doing, the farmer locks up a price now for delivery in the future. We then say that the farmer is **hedged** against movements in the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the notations\n",
    "\n",
    "* $t = $ current time  \n",
    "* $T = $ time of delivery  \n",
    "* $\\tau = T - t = $ time to maturity  \n",
    "* $S_{t} = $ current spot price of the asset in dollars  \n",
    "* $F_{t}(T) = $ current forward price of the asset for delivery at $T$ (also \n",
    "* written as $F_{t}$ or $F$ to avoid clutter)  \n",
    "* $V_{t} = $ current value of contract  \n",
    "* $r = $ current domestic risk-free rate for delivery at $T$  \n",
    "* $n = $ quantity, or number of units in contract\n",
    "\n",
    "The **face amount**, or **principal value**, of the contract is defined as the amount $nF$ to pay at maturity, like a bond. This is also called the **notional amount**. We will assume that interest rates are continuously compounded so that the present value of a dollar paid at expiration is $PV(\\$1) = e^{-r\\tau}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that the initial forward price is $F_{t} = \\$100$. A speculator agrees to buy $n = 500$ units for $F_{t}$ at $T$. At expiration, the payoff on the forward contract is determined in two steps as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The speculator pays $nF = \\$50000$ in cash and receives $500$ units of the underlying.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The speculator could then sell the underlying at the prevailing spot price $S_{T}$, for a profit of $n(S_{T} - F)$. For example, if the spot price is at $S_{T} = \\$120$, the profit is $500 \\times (\\$120 - \\$100) = \\$10000$. This is also the mark-to-market value of the contract at expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the value of the forward contract at expiration, for one unit of the underlying asset, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{T} = S_{T} - F$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the value of the contract at expiration is derived from the purchase and **physical delivery** of the underlying asset. There is a payment of cash in exchange for the actual asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another mode of settlement is **cash settlement**. This involves simply measuring the market value of the asset upon maturity, $S_{T}$, and agreeing for the long side to receive $nV_{T} = n(S_{T} - F)$. This amount can be positive or negative, involving a profit or loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valuing Forward Contracts\n",
    "When evaluating forward contracts, two important questions arise. First, how is the current forward price $F_{t}$ determined? Second, what is the current value $V_{t}$ of an outstanding forward contract?\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we assume that the underlying asset pays no income and no transaction costs, that is, zero bid-ask spread on spot and forward quotations, as well as the ability to lend and borrow at the same risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, forward contracts are established so that their initial value is zero. This is achieved by setting the forward price $F_{t}$ appropriately by **no-arbitrage relationship** between the cash and forward markets. No-arbitrage is a situation where positions with the same payoffs have the same price. This rules out situations where **arbitrage profits** can exist. Arbitrage is a zero-risk, zero-net investment strategy that still generates profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this strategies:\n",
    "* Buy one share/unit of the underlying asset at the spot price $S_{t}$ and hold to time $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enter a forward contract to buy one share/unit of same underlying asset at the forward price $F_{t}$. In order to have sufficient funds at maturity to pay $F_{t}$, we invest the present value of $F_{t}$ in an interest-bearing account. This is the present value $F_{t}e^{-r\\tau}$. The forward price $F_{t}$ is set so that the initial cost of the forward contract, $V_{t}$, is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two portfolios are economically equivalent because they will be identical at maturity. Each will contain one share of the asset. Hence their up-front cost must be the same. To avoid arbitrage, we must have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_{t} = F_{t}e^{-r\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation defines the fair forward price $F_{t}$ such that the initial value of the contract is zero. More generally, the term multiplying $F_{t}$ is the present value factor for maturity $\\tau$, or $PV(\\$1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the forward rate is higher than the spot rate. This reflects the fact that there is no down payment to enter the forward contract, unlike for the cash position. As a result, the forward price must be higher than the spot price to reflect the time value of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstracting from transaction costs, any deviation creates an arbitrage opportunity. This can be taken advantage of by buying the cheap asset and selling the expensive one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valuing an Off-Market Forward Contract\n",
    "We can use the same reasoning to evaluate an outstanding forward contract with a locked-in delivery price of $K$. In general, such as contract will have nonzero value because $K$ differs from the prevailing forward rate. Such a contract is said to be **off-market**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider these strategies:\n",
    "* Buy one share/unit of the underlying asset at the spot price $S_{t}$ and hold it until time $T$.\n",
    "* Enter a forward contract to buy one share/unit of same underlying asset at the price $K$; in order to have sufficient funds at maturity to pay $K$, we invest the present value of $K$ in an interest-bearing account. This present value is also $Ke^{-r\\tau}$. In addition, we have to pay the market value of the forward contract, or $V_{t}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The up-front cost of the two portfolios must be identical. Hence, we must have $V_{t} + Ke^{-r\\tau} = S_{t}$, or\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{t} = S_{t} - Ke^{-r\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "which defines the market value of an outstanding long position. This gains value when the underlying $S$ increases in value. A short position would have the reverse sign. Later, we will extend this relationship to the measurement of risk by considering the distribution of the underlying risk factors, $S_{t}$ and $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valuing Forward Contracts with Income Payments\n",
    "We previously considered a situation where the asset produces no income payment. In practice, the asset may be\n",
    "\n",
    "* A stock that pays a regular dividend\n",
    "* A bond that pays a regular coupon\n",
    "* A stock index that pays a dividend stream approximated by a continuous yield\n",
    "* A foreign currency that pays a foreign-currency-denominated interest rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever income is paid on the asset, we can usefully classify the payment into **discrete**, that is, fixed dollar amounts at regular points in time, or on a **continuous** basis, that is, accrued in proportion to the time the asset is held. We must assume that the income payment is fixed or is certain. More generally, a storage cost is equivalent to a negative dividend.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use these definitions:  \n",
    "$D = $ discrete (dollar) dividend or coupon payment  \n",
    "$r^{*}_{t}(T) = $ foreign risk-free rate for delivery at $T$  \n",
    "$q_{T}(T) = $ dividend yield\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the payment is a dividend or a foreign interest rate, the principle is the same. We can afford to invest less in the asset up front to get on unit at expiration. This is because the income payment can be reinvested into the asset. Alternatively, we can borrow against the value of the income payment to increase our holding of the asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that all prices ($S$, $F$) are measured in the domestic currency. For example, $S$ could be expressed in terms of the U.S. dollar price of the euro, in which case $r$ is the U.S. interest rate and $r^{*}$ is the euro interest rate. Conversely, if $S$ is the Japanese yen price of the U.S. dollar, $r$ will represent the Japanese interest rate, and $r^{*}$ the U.S. interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pricing formula can be extended to \n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{t}e^{-r\\tau} = S_{t} - PV(D)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $PV(D)$ is the present value of the dividend/coupon payments. If there is more than one payment, $PV(D)$ represents the sum of the present values of each individual payment, discounted at the appropriate risk-free rate. With storage costs, we need to add the present value of storage costs $PV(C)$ to the right side of this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is similar for an asset that pays a continuous income, defined per unit of time instead of discrete amounts. Holding a foreign currency, for instance, should be done through an interest-bearing account paying interest that accrues with time. Over the horizon $\\tau$, we can afford to invest less up front, $S_{t}e^{-r^{*}\\tau}$, in order to receive one unit at maturity. The right-hand side of the equation is now \n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{t}e^{-r\\tau} = S_{t}e^{-r^{*}\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the forward price should be \n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{t} = S_{t}e^{-r^{*}\\tau}/e^{-r\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead interest rates are annually compounded, this gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{t} = S_{t}(1 + r)^{\\tau}/(1 + r^{*})^{\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation can be also written in terms of the forward premium or discount, which is \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{F_{t} - S_{t}}{S_{t}} = e^{-r^{*}\\tau}/e^{-r\\tau} - 1 = exp(r - r*)\\tau \\approx (r - r*)\\tau$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $r* < r$, we have $F_{t} > S_{t}$ and the asset trades at a **forward premium**. Coversely, if $r* > r$, $F_{t} < S_{t}$ and the asset trades at a **forward discount**. Thus the forward price is higher or lower than the spot price, depending on whether the yield on the asset is lower than or higher than the domestic risk-free interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation is also known as **interest rate parity** when dealing with currencies. Also note that both the spot and forward prices must be expressed in dollars per unit of the foreign currency when the domestic currency interest rate is $r$. This is the case, for the dollar/euro or dollar/pound exchange rate. However, if the exchange rate is expressed in foreign currency per dollar, then $r$ must be the rate on the foreign currency. For the yen/dollar rate, $S$ is in yen per dollar, $r$ is the yen interest rate, and $r^{*}$ is the dollar interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward price differs from the spot price to reflect the time value of money and the income yield on the underlying asset. It is higher than the spot price if the yield on the asset is lower than the domestic risk-free interest rate and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "With income payments, the value of an outstanding forward contract is \n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{t} = S_{t}e^{-r^{*}\\tau} - Ke^{ir\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $F_{t}$ is the new, current forward price, we can also write\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{t} = F_{t}e^{-r\\tau} - Ke^{-r\\tau} = (F_{t} - K)e^{-r\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a useful alternative formula for the valuation of a forward contract. The intuition here is that we could liquidate the outstanding forward contract by entering a reverse position at the current forward rate. The payoff at expiration is $(F - K)$, which, discounted back to the present, gives the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current value of an outstanding forward contract can be found by enterin an offsetting forward position and discounting the net cash flow at expiration."

    "### Overview\n",
    "Forward contracts allow users to take positions that are economically equivalent to those in the underlying cash markets. Unlike cash markets, however, they do not involve substantial up-front payments. Thus, forward contracts can be interpreted as having leverage. Leverage is efficient, as it makes our money work harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage creates credit risk for the counterparty, however. For a cash trade, there is no leverage. When a speculator buys a stock at the price of $\\$100$, the counterparty receives the cash and has no credit risk. Instead, when a speculator enters a forward contract to buy an asset at the price of $\\$105$, there is no upfront payment. In effect, the speculator borrows from the counterparty to invest in the asset. There is a risk of default should the value of the contract to the speculator fall sufficiently. In response, futures contracts have been structured so as to minimize credit risk for all counterparties. Otherwise, from a market risk standpoint, futures contracts are basically identical to forward contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Futures contracts** are standardized, negotiable, and exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset. They differ from forward contracts as follows.\n",
    "* **Trading on organized exchanges.** In contrast to forwards, which are OTC contracts tailored to customers' needs, futures are traded on organized exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standardization.** Futures contracts are offered with a limited choice of expiration dates. They trade in fixed contract sizes. This standardization ensures an active secondary market for many future contracts, which can be easily traded, purchased, or resold. In other words, most futures contracts have good liquidity. The trade-off is that futures are less precisely suited to the needs of some hedgers, which creates basis risk (to be defined later).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clearinghouse.** Futures contracts are also standardized in terms of the counterparty. After each transaction is confirmed, the clearinghouse basically interposes itself between the buyer and the seller, ensuring the performance of the contract. Thus, unlike forward contracts, counterparties do not have to worry about the credit risk of the other side of the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Marking to market.** As the clearinghouse now has to deal with the credit risk of the two original counterparties, it has to monitor credit risk closely. This is achieved by daily marketing to market, which involves settlement of the gains and losses on the contract every day. This will avoid the accumulation of large losses over time, potentially leading to an expensive default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Margins.** Although daily settlement accounts for past losses, it does not provide a buffer against future losses. This is the goal of **margins**, which represent posting of collateral that can be seized should the other party default. The **initial margin** must be posted when initiating the position. If the equity in the account fails below the **maintenance margin**, the customer is required to provide additional funds to cover the initial margin. The level of margin depends on the instrument and the type of position; in general, less volatile instruments or hedged positions require lower margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since futures trading is centralized on an exchange, it is easy to collect and report aggregate trading data. **Volume** is the number of contracts traded during the day, which is a flow item. **Open interest** represents the outstanding number of contracts at the close of the daym which is a stock item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valuing Futures Contracts\n",
    "Valuation principles for futures contracts are very similar to those for forward contracts. The main difference between the two types of contracts is that any profit or loss accrues during the life of the futures contract instead of all at once, at expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interest rates are assumed constant or determinisitic, forward and futures prices must be equal. With stochastic interest rates, there may be a small difference, depending on the correlation between the value of the asset and interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the correlation is zero, then it makes no difference whether payments are received earlier or later. The futures price must be the same as the forward price. In contrast, consider a contract whose price is positively correlated with the interest rate. If the value of the contract goes up, it is more likely that interest rates will go up as well. This implies that profits can be withdrawn and reinvested at a higher rate. Relative to forward contracts, this marketing-to-market feature is beneficial to a long futures position. As a result, the futures price must be higher in equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this effect is observable only for interest-rate futures contracts, whose value is negatively correlated with interest rates. Because this feature is unattractive for the long position, the futures price must be lower than the forward price."

The underlying asset can be an interest rate, an exchange rate, an equity, a commodity price, or any other index. Typically, swaps are established for longer periods than forwards and futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swaps can be viewed as a portfolio of forward contracts. They can be priced using valuation formulas for forwards. Our currency swap, for instance, can be viewed as a combination of $10$ forward contracts with various face values, maturity dates, and rates of exchange."
