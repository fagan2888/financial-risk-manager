    "The preceding notebook shows how a risk manager can characterize the risk of a portfolio using a frequency distribution. This process uses the tools of probability, a mathematical abstraction that constructs the distribution of random variable. These random variables are financial risk factors, such as movements in stock prices, in bond prices, in exchange rates, and in commodity prices. These risk factor are then transformed into profits and losses on the portfolio, which can be described by a probability distribution function.\n",

    "The classical approach to probability is based on the concept of the **random variable ($RV$)**. This can be viewed as the outcome from throwing a die. Each realization is generated from a fixed process. If the die is perfectly symmetrical, with six-faces, we could say that the probability of observing a face with a specified number in one throw is $p = 1/6$.\n",
