    "The preceding notebook shows how a risk manager can characterize the risk of a portfolio using a frequency distribution. This process uses the tools of probability, a mathematical abstraction that constructs the distribution of random variable. These random variables are financial risk factors, such as movements in stock prices, in bond prices, in exchange rates, and in commodity prices. These risk factor are then transformed into profits and losses on the portfolio, which can be described by a probability distribution function.\n",

    "The classical approach to probability is based on the concept of the **random variable ($RV$)**. This can be viewed as the outcome from throwing a die. Each realization is generated from a fixed process. If the die is perfectly symmetrical, with six-faces, we could say that the probability of observing a face with a specified number in one throw is $p = 1/6$.\n",
    "### Univariate distribution functions\n",
    "For example, a random variable $X$ is characterized by a **distribution function**, \n",
    "\n",
    "$F(x) = P(X \\leq x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the probability that the realization of the random variable $X$ ends up less than or equal to the given number $x$. This is also called a **cumulative distribution function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the variable $X$ takes discrete values, this distribution is obtained by summing the step values less than or equal to $x$. That is\n",
    "\n",
    "$F(x) = \\Sigma_{xj \\leq x}f(x_{j})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the function $f(x)$ is called the **frequency function** or the **probability density function ($p.d.f$)**.\n",
    "\n",

    "Often, the random variable will be described interchangeably by its distribution or its density.\n",

    "A random variable is characterized by its distribution function. We can summarize it by a few parameters, or **moments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the expected value for $x$, or **mean**, is given by the integral \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu = E(X) = \\int^{+\\infty}_{-\\infty}xf(x)dx$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In fact, value at risk ($VAR$) can be interpreted as the cutoff point such that a loss will not happen with probability greater than $p = 95%$. If $f(u)$ us the distribution of profit and losses on the portfolio, $VAR$ is defined from \n",
    "\n",
    "$F(x) = \\int^{x}_{-\\infty}f(u)du = (1 - p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the right-tail probability, and $c$ the usual left-tail probability. $VAR$ can be defined as minus the quantile itself, or alternatively, the deviation between the expected value and the quantile, \n",

    "$VAR(c) = E(X) - Q(X, c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $VAR$ is typically reported as a loss (i.e., a positive number), which explains the negative sign.\n",

    "Negative skewness indicates that the distribution has a long left tail, which indicates a high probability of observing large negative values. If this represents the distribution of profits and losses for a portfolio, this is a dangerous situation.\n",

    "The scaled fourth moment is the **kurtosis**, which describes the degree of flatness of a distribution, or width of its tails. It is defined as \n",

    "\n",
    "Because of the fourth power, large observations in the tail will have a large weight and hence create large kurtosis. Such a distribution is called **leptokurtic**, or **fat-tailed**. This parameter is very important for risk management. A kurtosis of $3$ is considered average, and represents a normal distribution. High kurtosis indicates a higher probability of extreme movements. A distribution with kurtosis lower than $3$ is called **platykurtic**."
