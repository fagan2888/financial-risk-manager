    "The preceding notebook shows how a risk manager can characterize the risk of a portfolio using a frequency distribution. This process uses the tools of probability, a mathematical abstraction that constructs the distribution of random variable. These random variables are financial risk factors, such as movements in stock prices, in bond prices, in exchange rates, and in commodity prices. These risk factor are then transformed into profits and losses on the portfolio, which can be described by a probability distribution function.\n",
