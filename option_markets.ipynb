    "### Basic Options\n",
    "**Options** are instruments that give their holder the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified price until a specified expiration date. The specified delivery price is known as the **delivery price**, or **exercise price**, or **strike price**, and is denoted by $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options to buy are **call options**. Options to sell are **put options**. As options confer a right to the purchaser of the option, but not an obligation, they will be exercised only if they generate profits. In contrast, forwards involve an obligation to either buy or sell and can generate profits or losses. Like forward contracts, options can be purchased or sold. In the latter case, the seller is said to **write** the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the timing of exercise, options can be classified into European or American options. **European options** can be exercised at any time, before or at maturity. Because American options include the right to exercise at maturity, they must be at least as valuable as European options. In practice, however, the value of this early exercise feature is small, as an investor can generally receive better value by reselling the option on the open market instead of exercising it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use these notations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ K = $ exercise price\n",
    "$ c = $ value of European call option\n",
    "$ C = $ value of American call option\n",
    "$ p = $ value of European put option\n",
    "$ P = $ value of American put option\n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff profile of a long position in a call option at expiration is \n",
    "\n",
    "$C_{T} = Max(S_{\\tau} - K, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff profile of a long position in a put option is\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{T} = Max(K - S_{\\tau}, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current asset price $S_{t}$ is close to the strike price $K$, the option is said to be **at-the-money**. If the current asset price $S_{t}$ is such that the option could be exercised now at a profit, the option is said to be **in-the-money**. If the remaining situation is present, the option is said to be **out-of-the-money**. A call will be in-the-money if $S_{t} > K$. A put will be in-the-money if $S_{t} < K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because buying options can generate only profits (at worst zero) at expiration, an option contract must be a valuable asset (or at worst have zero value). This means that a payment is needed to acquire the contract. This up-front payment, which is much like an insurance premium, is called the option **premium**. This premium cannot be negative. An option becomes more expensive as it moves in-the-money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the payoffs on options must take into account this cost (for long positions) or benefit (for short positions). To compute the total payoff, we should translate all option payoffs by the future value of the premium, that is, $ce^{r\\tau}$, for European call options.\n",
    "\n",
    "We summarize the payoff patterns on long and short positions in a call and a put contract. Unlike those of forwards, these payoffs are **nonlinear** in the underlying spot price. Sometimes they are referred to as the \"hockey stick\" diagrams. This is because forwards are obligations, whereas options are rights. Note that the positions for the same contract are symmetrical around the horizontal axis. For a given spot price, the sum of the profit or loss for the long and for the short is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that long option positions have limited downside risk, which is the loss the premium. Short call option positions have unlimited downside risk because there is no upper limit on $S$. The worst loss on short put positions occurs if $S$ goes to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have covered options on cash instruments. Options can also be struck on futures. When exercising a call, the investor becomes long the futures contract. Conversely, exercising a put creates a short position in the futures contract. Because positions in futures are equivalent to leveraged positions in the underlying cash instrument, options on cash instruments and on futures are economically equivalent."

    "### Put-Call Parity\n",
    "These option payoffs can be used as the basic building blocks for more complex positions. A long position in the underlying asset can be decomposed into a long call plus a short put with the same strike prices and maturities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long call provides the equivalent of the upside while the short put generates the same downside risk as holding the asset. This link creates a relationship between the value of the call and that of the put, also known as **put-call parity**. The relationship examines the payoff at initiation and at expiration under the two possible states of the world. We consider only European options which the same maturity and exercise price. Also, we assume that there is no income payment on the underlying asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio consists of a long position in the call, a short position in the put, and an investment to ensure that we will be able to pay the exercise price at maturity. Long positions are represented by negative values, as they represent outflows, or costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table shows that the final payoffs to portfolio $(1)$ add up to $S_{T}$ in the two states of the world, which is the same as a long position in the asset itself. Hence, to avoid arbitrage, the initial payoff must be equal to the current cost of the asset, which is $S_{t} = S$. So, we must have $-c + p - Ke^{-r\\tau} = - S$. More generally, with income paid at the rate of $r^{*}$, put-call parity can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$c - p = Se^{-r^{*}\\tau} - Ke^{-r\\tau} = (F - K)e^{-r\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $c \\geq 0$ and $p \\geq 0$, this relationship can also be used to determine lower bounds for European calls and puts. Note that the relationship does not hold exactly for American options since there is a likelihood of early exercise, which could lead to mismatched payoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this relationship can be used to determine the **implied dividend yield** from market prices. We observe $c$, $p$, $S$, and $r$ and can solve for $y$ or $r^{*}$. This yield is used for determining the forward rate in **dividend swaps**, which are contracts where the payoff is indexed to the actual dividends paid over the horizon, minus the implied dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "A long position in an asset is equivalent to a long position in a European call with a short position in an otherwise identical put, combined with a risk-free position."

    "### Combination of Options\n",
    "Options can be combined in different ways, either with each other or with the underlying asset. Consider first combinations of the underlying asset and an option. A long position in the stock can be accompanied by a short sale of a call to collect the optio premium. This operation is called a **covered call**. Likewise, a long position in the stock can be accompanied by a purchase of a put to protect the downside. This operation is called a **protective put**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options can also be combined with an underlying position to limit the range of potential gains and losses. Suppose an investor is long a stock, currently trading at $\\$10$. The investor can buy a put with a low strike price (e.g., $\\$7$), partially financed by the sale of a call with high strike (e.g., $\\$12$). Ignoring the net premium, the highest potential gain is $\\$2$ and the worst loss is $\\$3$. Such a strategy is called a **collar**. If the strike prices were the same, this would be equivalent to a short stock position, which creates a net payoff of exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also combine a call and a put with the same or different strike prices and maturities. When the strike prices of the call and the put and their maturities are the same, the combination is referred to as a **straddle**. The below figure shows how to construct a long straddle (i.e., buying a call and a put with the same maturity and strike price). This position is expected to benefit from a large price move, whether up or down. The reverse position is a short straddle. When the strike prices are different, the combination is referred to as a **strangle**. Since strangles are out-of-the-money, they are cheaper to buy than straddles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have concentrated on positions involving two classes of options. One can, however, establish positions with one class of options, called **spreads**. Calendar or **horizontal spreads** correspond to different maturities. **Vertical spreads** correspond to different strike prices. The names of the spreads are derived from the manner in which they are listed in newspapers: time is listed horizontally and strike prices are listed vertically. **Diagonal spreads** move across maturities and strike prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a **bull spread** is positioned to take advantage of an increase in the price of the underlying asset. Conversely, a **bear spread** represents a bet on a falling price. The figure shows how to construct a bull(ish) vertical spread with two calls with the same maturity. This could also be constructed with puts, however. Here, the spread is formed by buying a call option with a low exercise price $K_{1}$ and selling another call with a higher exercise price $K_{2}$. Note that the cost of the first call $c(S, K_{1})$ must exceed the cost of the second call $c(S, K_{2})$, because the first option is more in-the-memory than the second. Hence, the sum of the two premiums represents a net cose. At expiration, when $S_{T} > K_{2}$, the payoff is $Max(S_{T} - K_{1}, 0) - Max(S_{T} - K_{2}, 0) = (S_{T} - K_{1}) - (S_{T} - K_{2}) = K_{2} - K_{1}$, which is positive. Thus this position is expected to benefit from an up move, while incurring only limited downside risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreads involving more than two positions are referred to as butterfly or sandwich spreads. A **butterfly spread** involves three types of options with the same maturity: for example, a long call at a strike price $K_{1}$, two short calls at a higher strike price $K_{2}$, and a long call position at a higher strike price $K_{3}$, with the same spacing, the figure shows that this position is expected to benefit when the underlying asset price stays stable, close to $K_{2}$. The double position in the middle is called the body, and the others the wings. A sandwich spread is the opposite of a butterfly spread."

    "So far, we have examined the payoffs at expiration only. Also important is the instantaneous relationship between the option value and the current price $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a call, a higher price $S$ increases the current value of the option, but in a nonlinear, convex fashion. For a put, lower values for $S$ increase the value of the option, also in a convex fashion. As time goes by, the curved line approaches the hockey stick line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figures decompose the current premium into:\n",
    "* An **intrinsic value**, which basically consists of the value of the option if exercised today, or $Max(S_{t} - K, 0)$ for a call and $Max(K - S_{t}, 0)$ for a put\n",
    "* A **time value**, which consists of the remainder, reflecting the possibility that the option will create further gains in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "Options can be classified into:\n",
    "* **At-the-money**, when the current spot price is close to the strike price\n",
    "* **In-the-money**, when the intrinsic value is large\n",
    "* **Out-of-the-money**, when the spot price is much below the strike price for calls and conversely for puts (out-of-the-money options have zero intrinsic value)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also identify some general bounds for European options that should always be satisfied; otherwise there would be an arbitrage opportunity (i.e., a money machine). For simplicity, assume there is no dividend. We know that a European option is worth less than an American option. First, the current value of a call must be less than, or equal to, the asset price:\n",

    "\n",
    "$c_{t} \\geq S_{t} - Ke^{-r\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this, we could simply use put-call parity, or with $r^{*} = 0$, imposing the condition that $p \\geq 0$. Note that, since $e^{-r\\tau} < 1$, we must have $S_{t} - Ke^{-r\\tau} > S_{t} - K$ before expiration. Thus $S_{t} - Ke^{-r\\tau}$ is a more informative lower bound than $S_{t} - K$.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Early Exercise of Options\n",
    "These relationships can be used to assess the value of early exercise for American options. The basic trade-off arises between the value of the American option **dead**, that is, exercised, or **alive**, that is, nonexercised. Thus, the choice is between exercising the option and selling it on the open market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an American call on a non-dividend-paying stock. By exercising early, the holder gets exactly $S_{t} - K$. The value of the option alive, however, must be worth more than that of the equivalent European call. This must satisfy $c_{t} \\geq S_{t} - Ke^{-r\\tau}$, which is strictly greater than $S_{t} - K$ because $e^{-r\\tau} < 1$ with positive interest rates. Hence, an American call on a non-dividend-paying stock should never be exercised early.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only reason to exercise a call early is to capture a dividend payment. Intuitively, a high income payment makes holding the asset more attractive than holding the option. Thus American options on income-paying assets may be exercised early. Note that this applies also to options on futures, since the implied income stream on the underlying is the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "An American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock (or asset with no income) should never be exercised early. If the asset pays income, early exercise may occur, with a probability that increases with the size of the income payment.\n",

    "For an American put, we must have \n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{t} \\geq K - S_{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "because it could be exercised now. Unlike the relationship for calls, this lower bound $K - S_{t}$ is strictly greater than the lower bound for European puts $Ke^{-r\\tau} - S_{t}.$ So, we could have early exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide whether to exercise early, the holder of the option has to balance the benefit of exercising, which is to receive $K$ now instead of later, against the loss of killing the time value of the option. Because it is better to receive money now than later, it may be worth exercising the put option early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, American puts on non-income-paying assets could be exercised early, unlike calls. The probability of early exercise decreases for lower interest rates and with higher income payments on the asset. In each case, it becomes less attractive to sell the asset.\n",

    "The key idea of derivatives pricing is that of **replication**. In other words, we replicate the payoff on the option by a suitable portfolio of the underlying asset plus a position, long or short, in a risk-free bill.

To prevent arbitrage, the current value of the derivative must be the same as that of the portfolio.\n",

    "### Black-Scholes Valuation\n",
    "The Black-Sholes (BS) model is an application of these ideas that provides an elegant closed-form solution to the pricing of European calls. The derivation of the model is based on four assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Black-Sholes Model Assumptions**:\n",
    "1. The price of the underlying asset moves in a continuous fashion.\n",
    "2. Interest rates are known and constant.\n",
    "3. The variance of underlying asset returns is constant.\n",
    "4. Capital markets are perfect (i.e., short sales are allowed, there are no transaction costs or taxes, and markets operate continuously).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important assumption behind the model is that prices are continuous. This rules out discontinuities in the sample path, such as jumps, which cannot be hedged in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical process for the asset price is modeled by a geometric Brownian motion: Over a very short time interval, $dt$, the logarithmic return has a normal distribution with mean = $\\mu dt$ and variance = $\\sigma^{2}dt$. The total return can be modeled as \n",
    "\n",
    "$dS/S = \\mu dt + \\sigma dz$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the first term represents the drift component, and the second is the stochastic component, with $dz$ distributed normally with mean zero and variance $dt$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process implies that the logarithm of the ending price is distributed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$ln(S_{T}) = ln(S_{0}) + (\\mu - \\sigma^{2}/2)\\tau + \\sigma \\sqrt{\\tau} \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is a $N(0, 1)$ random variable. Hence, the price is lognormally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these assumptions, Black and Scholes derived a close-form formula for European options on a non-dividend-paying stock, called the **Black-Scholes model**. The key point of the analysis is that a position in the option can be replicated by a delta position in the underlying asset. Hence, a portfolio combining the asset and the option in appropriate proportions is locally risk-free, that is, for small movements in prices. To avoid arbitrage, this portfolio must return the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we can directly compute the present value of the derivative as the discounted expected payoff\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_{t} = E_{RN}[e^{-r\\tau}F(S_{T})]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the underlying asset is assumed to grow at the risk-free rate, and the discounting is also done at the risk-free rate. Here, the subscript $RN$ refers to the fact that the analysis assumes **risk neutrality**. In a risk-neutral world, the expected return on all securities must be the risk-free rate of interest, $r$. The reason is that risk-neutral investors do not require a risk premium to induce them to take risks. The BS model value can be computed assuming that all payoffs grow at the risk-free rate and are discounted at the same risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This risk-neutral valuation approach is without a doubt the most important tool in derivatives pricing. Before the Black-Scholes breakthrough, Samuelson had derived a very similar model in 1965, but with the asset growing at the rate $\\mu$ and discounting as some other rate $\\mu^{*}$. Because $\\mu$ and $\\mu^{*}$ are unknown, the Samuelson model was not practical. The risk-neutral valuation is merely an artificial method to obtain the correct solution, however. It does not imply that investors are risk-neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this approach has limited uses for risk management. The BS model can be used to derive the **risk-neutral probability** of exercising the option. But, for risk management, what matters is the actual probability of exercise, also called **physical probability**. This can differ from the RN probability.\n",

    "$c_{T} = Q \\times I(S_{T} - K)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I(x)$ is an indicator variable that takes the value of $1$ if $x \\geq 0$ and $0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the probability of ending in-the-money in a risk-neutral world is $N(d_{2}), the initial value of this option is simply$\n",
    "\n",
    "$c = Qe^{-r\\tau}N(d_{2})$\n",
    "\n",
    "These options involve a sharp discontinuity around the strike price. Just below $K$, their value is zero. Just above, the value is the notional $Q$. Due to this discontinuity, these options are very difficult to hedge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important class of options is barrier options. **Barrier options** are options where the payoff depends on the value of the asset hitting a barrier during a certain period of time. A **knock-out option** disappears if the price hits a certain barrier. A **knock-in option** comes into existence when the price hits a certain barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a knock-out option is the **down-and-out call**. This disappears if $S$ hits a specified level $H$ during its life. In this case, the knock-out price $H$ must be lower than the initial price $S_{0}$. The option that appears at $H$ is the **down-and-in call**. With identical parameters, the two options are perfectly complementary. When one disappears, the other appears. As a result, these two options must add up to a regular call option. Similarly, an **up-and-out call** ceases to exist when $S$ reaches $H > S_{0}$. The complementary option is the **up-and-in call**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compare price paths for the four possible combinations of calls. In all figures, the dark line describes the relevant price path during which the option is alive; the gray line describes the remaining path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphs illustrate that the down-and-out call and down-and-in call add up to the regular price path of a regular European call option. Thus, at initiation, the value of these two options must add up to\n",
    "\n",
    "$c = c_{D0} + c_{D1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all these values are positive (or at worst zero), the value of each premium $c_{D0}$ and $c_{D1}$ must be no greater than that of $c$. A similar reasoning applies to the two options in the right panels. Sometimes the option offers a **rebate** if it is knocked out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar combinations exist for put options. An **up-and-out put** ceases to exist when $S$ reaches $H > S_{0}$. A **down-and-out put** ceases to exist when $S$ reaches $H < S_{0}$. The only difference is that the option is exercised at maturity if $S < K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Barrier options are attractive because they are cheaper than the equivalent European option. This, of course, reflects the fact that they are less likely to be exercised than other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, these options are difficult to hedge because a discontinuity arises as the spot price get closer to the barrier. Just above the barrier, the option has positive value. For a very small movement in the asset price, going below the barrier, this value disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another widely used class of options is Asian options. **Asian options**, or **average rate options**, generate payoffs that depend on the average value of the underlying spot price during the life of the option, instead of the ending value. Define this as $S_{AVE}(t, T)$. The final payoff for a call is \n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{T} = Max(S_{AVE}(t, T) - K, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because an average is less variable than the final value at the end of the same period, such options are cheaper than regular options due to lower volatility. In fact, the price of the option can be treated like that of an ordinary option with the volatility set equal to $\\sigma /\\sqrt{3}$ and an adjustment to the dividend yield. As a result of the averaging process, such options are easier to hedge than ordinary options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chooser options** allow the holder to choose whether the option is a call or a put. At that point in time, the value of the option is \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_{t} = Max(c_{t}, p_{t})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it is a package of two options, a regular call plus an option to convert to a put. As a result, these options are more expensive than plain-vanilla options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compound options** are options on options. For example, a call on a call (cacall) allows the holder to pay a fixed strike $K_{1}$ on the first exercise date $T_{1}$ to receive a call, which itself gives the right to buy the asset at a fixed strike $K_{2}$ on the second exercise date $T_{2}$. The firsr option will be exercised only if the value of the second option on that date $c(S, K_{2}, T_{2})$ is greater than the strike price $K_{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, these options are used to hedge bids for business projects that may or may not be accepted and that involve foreign currency exposure. If the project is accepted at date $T_{1}$, the option is more likely to be exercised. The compound option is cheaper than a regular call option at inception, at the expense of a higher total cost if both options are exercised. Compound options also include calls on puts, puts on puts, and puts on calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **lookback options** have payoffs that depend on the extreme values of $S$ over the option's life. Define $S_{MAX}$ as the maximum and $S_{MIN}$ as the minimum. A fixed-strike lookback call option pays $Max(S_{MAX} - K, 0)$. A floating-strike lookback call option pays $Max(S_{T}-S_{MIN}, 0)$. These options are even more expensive than regular options."
