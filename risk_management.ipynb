    "- Assessing and monitoring those risks\n",
    "- Managing those risks if given the authority to do so\n",
    "- Communicating these risks to the decision makers\n",
    "\n",
    "A major function of the risk measurement process is to estimate the distribution of future profits and losses. The scale of the dollar returns should be proprtional to the initial investment, but the part of constructing the distribution of future rates of return is much difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we evaluate the quality of a risk management process? The occurrence of a large loss does not mean that risk management has failed. How can we tell whether the loss is due to bad luck or a flaw in the risk model?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to classify risks into 3 categories as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known knowns\n",
    "This category consists of risks that are properly identified and measured. Losses can still occur due to a combination of bad luck and portfolio decisions. Such losses, however, should not happen too often. If VAR at the 99% level of confidence is reported as 14.4%. Under this conditions, a string of consecutive losses of 15% or more several months in a row should be highly unusual. If this were to happen, it would be an indication of a flawed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known unknowns\n",
    "This category includes model weaknesses that are known or should be known to exist but are not properly measured by risk managers. For example, the risk manager could have ignored important known risk factors. Second, the distribution of risk factors, including volatilities and correlations, could be measured inaccurately. Third, the mapping process, which consists of replacing positions with exposures on the risk factors, could be incorrect. This is typically called **model risk**. Such risks can be evaluated using stress tests, which shock financial variables or models beyond typical ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another form of known unknown is **liquidity risk**. Most risk models assume that the position can be liquidated over the selected horizon. In practice, this depends on a number of factors. First is the intrinsic liquidity of the asset. Treasury bills, for instance, are much more liquid than high-yield bonds. They trade at a lower spread and with less market impact. Second is the size of the position. This is especially a problem when the position is very large relative to normal trading activity, which would require accepting a large price drop to execute the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unknown unknowns\n",
    "Events are totally outside the scope of most scenarios. Examples include regulatory risks such as the sudden restrictions on short sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, it is difficult to account fully for counterparty risk. It's not enough to know your counterparty; you need to know your counterparty's counterparties, too. In other words, there are network externalities. Understanding the full consequences of Lehman's failure would have required information on the entire topology of the financial network. Because no individual firm has access to this information, this contagion risk cannot be measured directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some form of liquidity risk is very difficult to assess. This involves the activity and positions of similar traders, which are generally unknown. In illiquid markets, a forced sale will be much more expensive if a number of similar portfolios are sold at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This category is sometimes called Knightian **uncertainty**, a form of risk that is immeasurable. Financial institutions cannot possibly carry enough capital to withstand massive counterparty failures, or systemic risk. In such situations, the central bank or the government becomes effectively the risk manager of last resort."

    "The first step of $CAPM$ is simlifying the covariance structure of stocks with a one-factor model. Define $R_{i,t}$ as the return on stock $i$ during month $t$, $R_{F, t}$ as the risk-free rate, and $R_{M, t}$ as the market return. Then run a regression of the excess return for $i$ on the market across time:\n",

For an actively managed portfolio $\\alpha$ is a measure of management skill. Finally, $\\epsilon_{i}$ is the residual, which has mean zero and is uncorrelated to $R_{M}$ by construction and to all other residuals by assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a one-factor model because any interactions between stocks are due to their exposure to the market. To simplify, ignore the risk-free rate and $\\alpha$, which is constant anyway. We now examine the covariance between two stocks, $i$ and $j$. This is a measure of the comovements between two random variables:\n",

    "Such simplified factor structure is extremely useful because it cuts down the number of parameters. With $100$ assets, there are in theory $N(N - 1)/2 = 4,950$ different pairwise covariances. In contrast, the factor structure involves only $100$ parameters, the $\\beta_{i}$, plus the variance of the market. \n",

    "This type of approximation lies at the heart of **mapping**, a widely used process in risk management. Mapping replaces individual postions by a smaller number of exposures on fundamental risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the total demand for each asset, as derived from the investors' portfolio optimization, match exactly the outstanding supply of assets (i.e., the issued shares of equities), the total demand can be aggregated because investors are assumed to have homogeneous expectations about the distribution of rates of return, which is also assumed normal. In addition, the model assumes the existence of a risk-free asset, which can be used for burrowing or lending, at the same rate. As is usual in most economic models, capital markets are assumed perfect. That is, there are no transaction costs, securities are infinitely divisible, and short sales are allowed.\n",

    "Portfolios located between $F$ and $M$ have a positive fraction allocated to each. Investors that are very risk-averse would hold a mix closer to $F$. Risk-tolerant investors would choose portfolios closer to, or even higher than, the market $M$. Portfolios above $M$ represent a levered position in the market (i.e., borrowing at the risk-free rate and reinvesting the proceeds in the stock market). \n",

    "Even so, all investors should hold the same relative proportion of stocks. For instance, Exxon accounts for about $4\\%$ of the market. According to the $CAPM$, all investors should hold $4\\%$ of their stock portfolio, whether small or large, in Exxon.\n",

    "This theory says that investors can easily diversify their portfolios. Most idiosyncratic risk washes away. In contrast, systematic risk cannot be diversified.\n",
